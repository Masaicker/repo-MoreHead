# MoreHead Frequently Asked Questions

## 1. Why is there no MoreHead button after entering the game?
The button only appears after **fully entering the game**, which means after entering the level and being able to control your character. You can press ESC and find the MoreHead button in the lower left corner.

## 2. Why are other players wearing my cosmetics?
Make sure all players have the same version of MoreHead installed. If someone hasn't installed the mod, they will see the default appearance, while you might see them wearing your cosmetics.

## 3. What should I do if MoreHead shows an error at startup?
MoreHead relies on the MenuLib library. If MenuLib is updated, it might cause errors. Please roll back the MenuLib version, and MoreHead will be updated later to support the latest version of MenuLib.
